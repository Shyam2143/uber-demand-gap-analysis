# Uber Demand-Supply Gap Analysis

This project analyzes Uber's ride request data to identify and solve the core reasons for trip cancellations and car unavailability during peak hours.

---

### Key Findings
* **Morning Rush (5-10 AM):** A high number of trips are **cancelled** by drivers for requests originating from the **City**.
* **Evening Peak (5-10 PM):** A severe **shortage of available cars** occurs for requests made from the **Airport**.
* **Overall Impact:** Over 58% of ride requests fail, with the service being least reliable when demand is highest.

---

### Recommendations
* Implement location-specific bonuses for drivers during peak hours (e.g., for City pickups in the morning).
* Use technology to better match supply with predictable demand at the Airport in the evening.

### Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
